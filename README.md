# Openfort Embedded Signer with Third-party Auth 

This is a template for integrating [**Openfort**](https://www.openfort.xyz/) into a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as for authentication. Check out the deployed app [here](https://create-next-app.openfort.xyz/)!

This demo uses NextJS's [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing).

## How to run locally

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

Copy the .env.local.example file into a file named .env.local in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

To enable your embedded signer, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/guides/auth/embedded-signer).

```
NEXTAUTH_SHIELD_ENCRYPTION_SHARE=
NEXTAUTH_SHIELD_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHIELD_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLIC_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

**2. Create a Policy and add a Contract**

[![Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/REQUIRED-TRUE-ORANGE.svg)](https://shields.io/)

You can create Policies and add Contracts in the Dashboard or with the API. This sample requires a Policy and a Contract to run. Once you've created them, and add its ID to `CollectButton`.

`contract_id` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-contract-object) for your contract. A contract has a chainId. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x2522F4Fc9aF2E1954a3D13f7a5B2683A00a4543A (NFT contract deployed in 80002 Amoy).

`policy_id` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-a-policy-object) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chainId. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLICY_ID=
```

**3. Get your Firebase Config**

First go to Firebase config: Console > Project settings > General adn create an app for your prohject if you still don't have one.

Then go to Firebase-Admin config: Console > Project settings > Service accounts and generate a "New Private Key"

Update `.env`

**4. Set up Firebase Auth in Openfort**
